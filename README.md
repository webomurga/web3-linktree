# Web3 Linktree

Web3 Linktree is a decentralized platform that allows users to create and share their own personalized portfolios of their online presence and achievements. Users can showcase their degen activities, such as gambling, trading, and investing in crypto; their NFT collections, such as digital art, music, and collectibles; their Wordcel blogs, where they express their opinions and insights on various topics; their work resume via Superteam Earn, where they can find and apply for freelance opportunities in the crypto space; and their other on-chain credentials, such as identity, reputation, and social tokens. Web3 Linktree leverages the Internet Computer Protocol, a blockchain network that hosts smart contracts and data on-chain, to provide a secure, transparent, and scalable solution for users to build their Web3 brand and community.

## Features

- **Web3 Identity**: Create and manage your Web3 identity, including your name, bio, profile picture, and links.
- **Activity Showcase**: Showcase your degen activities, NFT collections, Wordcel blogs, and other on-chain credentials.
- **Superteam Earn Integration**: Find and apply for freelance opportunities in the crypto space.
- **Secure and Scalable**: Leverage the Internet Computer Protocol for secure and transparent data storage.

## Vision

Web3 Linktree is a social consumer app that bridges the gap between the Web2 and Web3 worlds. It allows users to create and share their own Web3 identities, which are composed of their online activities and achievements across various crypto platforms. Web3 Linktree leverages the Internet Computer Protocol, a blockchain network that enables users to own and control their digital assets and identities, and to interact with smart contracts and data on-chain. Web3 Linktree aims to onboard the next wave of users to crypto, and to establish a new standard of reputation in the Web3 ecosystem.

## Project Roadmap & Future Plans

- **Define the smart contract interface and data structures for Web3 Linktree.** The smart contract should store the user's Web3 identity, which consists of their name, bio, profile picture, and a list of links to their online activities and achievements. The smart contract should also implement functions to create, update, delete, and query the user's Web3 identity, as well as to verify the ownership and authenticity of the links.
- **Implement the smart contract logic and business rules.** The smart contract should enforce the access control and permissions for the user's Web3 identity, such as requiring the user to sign transactions with their private key, and allowing the user to grant or revoke access to their links. The smart contract should also integrate with external APIs and oracles to fetch and validate the data from various crypto platforms, such as NFT marketplaces, DeFi protocols, and social networks.
- **Test and debug the smart contract for Web3 Linktree.** The smart contract should be tested using unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end tests to ensure its functionality, security, and performance. The smart contract should also be audited by a third-party security firm to identify and fix any potential vulnerabilities or bugs.
- **Design and develop the front-end user interface and user experience.** The front-end should provide a simple and intuitive way for the user to create and manage their Web3 identity, as well as to view and interact with other users' Web3 identities. The front-end should also support various features, such as responsive design, dark mode, social sharing, and analytics.
- **Connect the front-end with the smart contract.** The front-end should use a web3 library or framework to communicate with the smart contract and the Internet Computer Protocol. The front-end should also handle the user authentication, authorization, and encryption using the user's private key and wallet.
- **Deploy and launch the Web3 Linktree app.** The smart contract should be deployed to the Internet Computer Protocol mainnet, and the front-end should be hosted on a decentralized storage platform or a traditional web server. The app should also be registered and verified on the Internet Computer Protocol's network nervous system, which governs the governance and economics of the network.
